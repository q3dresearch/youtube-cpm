"""The parts every chart in this recipe shares, and the frame it has to declare.

    python3 plate.py        # print the frame each chart declares

**Why this exists.** The charts drifted. The first eight carried about 1,400 characters of
text each; by the fourteenth it was 3,244 characters against 27 drawn marks — a hundred and
twenty characters of prose per thing on the page. They had become essays with a graphic
attached, and the prose was method: how the null was built, which control was added, why a
figure was discarded. **That belongs in the recipe, which is long-form by design. The plate
has to carry the finding and what to do about it.**

They had also stopped saying who they were for. A reader could not tell from the page whether
a chart was addressed to a regulator, an entrant, or someone about to quote a number, nor what
they were supposed to do differently having read it.

So every chart now declares four things, and `frame()` puts three of them under the title in
the space the descriptive paragraph used to occupy:

- **for** — the reader it is addressed to, named as a role, not "the reader"
- **decide** — the choice in front of that reader, phrased as a choice and not a topic
- **wrong if** — the observation that would falsify it

The fourth is the title, which states the finding as a sentence rather than a subject.

**`wrong if` is the one that does the work.** A chart that cannot name what would falsify it is
usually describing rather than claiming, and that is worth discovering before it is published
rather than after someone asks.
